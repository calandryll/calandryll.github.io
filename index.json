In Delaware, blooms normally occur between July and October, yet no in‐depth analyses of the causes and predictors exist. A study using commercially available, high‐frequency, continuous, and automated biogeochemical sensors at Coursey Pond, Delaware, a pond known for perennial summer blooms, was conducted to investigate how hydrophysical and hydrochemical conditions affect bloom dynamics. Cyanobacterial abundance (based on the in vivo phycocyanin fluorescence and phycocyanin/chlorophyll fluorescence ratios) increases during periods of high water temperatures (up to 32°C), low discharge through the pond (mean hydraulic residence time ≥5 d) with evaporative concentration of dissolved solids, and decreasing NO3− concentrations (reaching −1, the detection limit). These conditions lead to the uptake and depletion of bioavailable N in the pond surface waters and provide a competitive advantage for temperature‐tolerant and N‐fixing cyanobacteria. Irrigation water use within the watershed can exceed pond discharge during drier summer months, enhancing bloom‐forming conditions. Bloom intensity varies due to storms but persists until mid‐October to mid‐November when temperatures cool, daylength decreases, and discharge and NO3− concentration recovers. Changes in these easily monitored physical and chemical parameters can serve to anticipate the onset, intensity, persistence, and the eventual dissipation of cyanobacterial blooms at Coursey Pond and similar ponds elsewhere. Therefore, the use of sensors and high‐frequency data has the potential to assist in forecasting and management of blooms.","tags":["\"harmful algal blooms\"","\"cyanobacteria\""],"title":"Hydrophysical and Hydrochemical Controls of Cyanobacterial Blooms in Coursey Pond, Delaware (USA)","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Christopher R.

Integrating these methods into routine monitoring and management strategies, however, has been slow. While comparisons to microscopy have been made, direct comparisons between molecular methods using environmental samples are sparse. Here, we directly compare qPCR to SHA for enumerating the harmful algal species, Heterosigma akashiwo, in environmental samples collected in Delaware’s inland bays. To ensure comparability, a single cellular homogenate was generated from field samples and split for analysis by qPCR and SHA. Results show a significant correlation between qPCR and SHA when Heterosigma is above bloom levels (1 × 105 cells L−1), but not during non-bloom conditions. qPCR and SHA were also more highly correlated when samples were collected at lower temperatures (−1), independent of Heterosigma cell concentration. There was no evidence of cross-reactivity in primers and probes for H. akashiwo during blooms of the closely related species, Chattonella subsalsa. However, qPCR to SHA ratios were elevated during blooms of other phytoplankton species, suggesting suppression of the SHA signal or enhancement of qPCR. Results of this study may have significant implications for research, where precise evaluations of cell numbers are often required. However, precise cell counts at non-bloom levels may not be as critical to management, suggesting either technique could be incorporated into rapid and effective decision making.","tags":["\"delaware inland bays\"","\"harmful algal blooms\"","\"heterosigma akashiwo\"","\"qpcr\"","\"sandwich hybridization assay\""],"title":"Critical comparison of molecular methods for detection and enumeration of the harmful algal species, Heterosigma akashiwo, in environmental water samples","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Stephen F.

Three different flow configurations of the SeapHOx sensor equipped with a Honeywell Durafet and its integrated internal (Ag/AgCl reference electrode containing a 4.5 M KCl gel liquid junction) and external (solid-state chloride ion selective electrode, Cl-ISE) reference electrodes were deployed for four periods between April 2015 and September 2016. In this environment, the Honeywell Durafet proved capable of making high-resolution and high-frequency pH measurements on the total scale between pH 6.8 and 8.4. Natural pH fluctuations of 1 pH unit were routinely captured over a range of timescales. The sensor pH collected between May and August 2016 using the most refined SeapHOx configuration exhibited good agreement with multiple sets of independently measured reference pH values. When deployed in conjunction with rigorous discrete sampling and calibration schemes, the sensor pH had a root-mean squared error ranging between 0.011 and 0.036 pH units across a wide range of salinity relative to both pHT calculated from measured dissolved inorganic carbon and total alkalinity and pHNBS measured with a glass electrode corrected to pHT at *in situ* conditions. The present work demonstrates the viability of the Honeywell Durafet to the measurement of pH to within the weather-level precision defined by the Global Ocean Acidification Observing Network (GOA-ON, ≤ 0.02 pH units) as a part of future estuarine CO2 chemistry studies undertaken in dynamic environments.","tags":[],"title":"Assessment of the suitability of Durafet-based sensors for pH measurement in dynamic estuarine environments","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Christopher R.

Correlations between Vibrio and phytoplankton abundance have been noted, suggesting that growth is enhanced during algal blooms or that association with phytoplankton provides a refuge from predation. Here, we investigated relationships between particle-associated Vibrio spp. and phytoplankton in Delaware's inland bays (DIB). The relative abundances of particle-associated Vibrio spp. and algal classes that form blooms in DIB (dinoflagellates, diatoms, and raphidophytes) were determined using quantitative PCR. The results demonstrated a significant correlation between particle-associated Vibrio abundance and phytoplankton, with higher correlations to diatoms and raphidophytes than to dinoflagellates. Species-specific associations were examined during a mixed bloom of Heterosigma akashiwo and Fibrocapsa japonica (Raphidophyceae) and indicated a significant positive correlation for particle-associated Vibrio abundance with H. akashiwo but a negative correlation with F. japonica . Changes in Vibrio assemblages during the bloom were evaluated using automated ribosomal intergenic spacer analysis (ARISA), which revealed significant differences between each size fraction but no significant change in Vibrio assemblages over the course of the bloom. Microzooplankton grazing experiments showed that losses of particle-associated Vibrio spp. may be offset by increased growth in the Vibrio population. Moreover, analysis of Vibrio assemblages by ARISA also indicated an increase in the relative abundance for specific members of the Vibrio community despite higher grazing pressure on the particle-associated population as a whole. The results of this investigation demonstrate links between phytoplankton and Vibrio that may lead to predictions of potential health risks and inform future management practices in this region.","tags":["\"delaware inland bays\"","\"harmful algal blooms\"","\"heterosigma akashiwo\"","\"qpcr\"","\"vibrio\""],"title":"Community-Level and Species-Specific Associations between Phytoplankton and Particle-Associated Vibrio Species in Delaware's Inland Bays","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Christopher R.

Here we directly compare quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR) and sandwich hybridization assay (SHA) for enumerating the raphidophyte Heterosigma akashiwo at several points during its growth phase, over a diel cycle and with macronutrient stress in laboratory cultures. To ensure consistency between comparisons, a single cellular homogenate was generated from each culture and split for analysis by qPCR and SHA. Since the homogenate was generated from the same number of cells during each experiment, results reflect changes in nucleic acid content (rRNA and DNA) at each time point or in response to environmental conditions relative to a reference sample. Results show a greater level of precision in SHA results which contributed to significant (2–3 fold) differences in rRNA content per cell in several of these analyses. There was significantly greater rRNA content during lag and exponential phases compared to stationary phase cultures, and a significant decrease in rRNA content during the light cycle compared to cells harvested in the dark. In contrast, there were no significant differences in DNA content per cell as determined by qPCR over a diel cycle or during different growth phases. There was also no decrease in either rRNA or DNA content for cultures under low P conditions compared to nutrient replete conditions. However, both rRNA and DNA content were significantly lower under N stress when compared to nutrient replete conditions. Results of this study suggest that growth stage, nutrient stress and cell cycle may impact molecular analyses, and that physiological status should be taken into account when using these methods for HAB monitoring.","tags":["\"delaware inland bays\"","\"harmful algal blooms\"","\"heterosigma akashiwo\"","\"qpcr\"","\"sandwich hybridization assay\""],"title":"Effects of growth phase, diel cycle and macronutrient stress on the quantification of Heterosigma akashiwo using qPCR and SHA","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Cameron Doll","Christopher R.

To verify molecular data, all experiments included cell counts using light microscopy and a Sedgewick Rafter chamber. Results of standard curves for several geographically distinct strains using SHA were similar to prior research whereas others exhibited significantly different slopes, suggesting physiological differences between isolates. Data generated by qPCR showed a high degree of correlation with SHA responses. We also investigated the use of each method for quantifying H. akashiwo samples preserved with Lugol's iodine solution. Neither SHA nor qPCR produced results that were significantly different from initial values for Lugol's preserved samples stored under refrigeration for up to 4 months. By comparison, samples stored at room temperature exhibited a highly significant decline in responses relative to controls after 4 months using both assays as well as a marked increase in ΔΔCt within 24 hours using qPCR followed by a decline and lack of signal after 1 month. To determine whether an environmental matrix would influence assay results, natural seawater samples were spiked with H. akashiwo culture.
