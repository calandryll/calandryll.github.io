Identification of phosphorus (P) sources and their load contributions are required for the development of effective nutrient management plans. In this research, multi-isotope proxies were applied to track P sources and evaluate their relative contributions in Love Creek, a coastal estuary in Delaware. The isotope values of carbon (ca. −22‰), nitrogen (ca.+6‰), and phosphate oxygen (ca.+18‰) of agricultural soils under different agricultural practices are generally similar even though their concentrations are distinctly different from forest soils ($δ$13C: ca. −27‰; $δ$13N: ca.+2‰; $δ$18OP: ca.+22‰). Comparison of these parameters among potential land sources (agricultural soils, forest soils, septic wastes, and plant debris) and sink (colloids in water) revealed that the plant debris and soils from forest sources are likely dominant sources of P in freshwater sites. The contribution of terrestrial P sources gradually decreased along the salinity gradient and agricultural soil sources gradually dominanted in the saline water portion of the creek. The variations of P loads due to weather-related discharge, changing land use and activities, and seasons were high and reflected the limitation of accurate estimation of sources. Overall, these results provide improved insights into potential sources and biogeochemical processes in the estuary, which are expected to be useful for water quality monitoring programs.","tags":["\"love creek watershed\"","\"delaware inland bays\""],"title":"Tracing the sources of phosphorus along the salinity gradient in a coastal estuary using multi-isotope proxies","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Christopher R.

For monitoring efforts, *Enterococcus* has been widely adopted by the state to indicate the presence of fecal matter from warm-blooded animals and to establish Primary and Secondary Contact Recreation criteria. In this study, we examined sites within the Love Creek watershed, a tributary of the Rehoboth bay, using next-generation sequencing and SourceTracker to determine sources of potential fecal contamination and compared to bacterial communities to chemical and nutrient concentrations. Microbial community from fecal samples of ten different types of animals and one human sample were used to generate a fecal library for community- based microbial source tracking. Orthophosphate and total dissolved solids were among the major factors associated with community composition. SourceTracker analysis of the monthly samples from the Love Creek watershed indicated the majority of the microbial community were attributed to “unknown” sources, i.e. wildlife. Those that attribute to known sources were primarily domestic animals, i.e. cat and dog. These results suggest that at the state level these methods are capable of giving the start for source tracking as a means to understanding bacterial contamination.","tags":["\"delaware inland bays\"","\"microbial source tracking\""],"title":"Microbial Source Tracking in the Love Creek Watershed, Delaware (USA)","type":"publication"},{"authors":[],"categories":[],"content":"Phytoplankton are of fundamental importance in the aquatic environment. Utilizing light, carbon dioxide, and various nutrients to photosynthetically produce biomass which provides the energy and material for the base of the food web. There are several thousands of extant algal species in the fresh and marine environment. In the marine environment alone, there are estimated 5,000 species of which 300 species are known to cause harmful algal blooms (HABs) where under certain conditions algal cells may proliferate into millions of cells per liter. Many HAB species produce toxins that can kill fish or other aquatic organisms or accumulate in fish or other organism’s tissues.\nIn the freshwater environment, the cyanobacteria are the most widespread and problematic algal taxa. The cyanobacteria are found in three distinct morphological groups: unicellular, either as solitary or aggregated colonies (i.e., Microcystis); differentiated filaments containing nitrogen fixing cells called heterocysts (i.e., Anabaena); and undifferentiated, nonheterocystous filaments (i.e., Oscillatoria). Nuisance and potentially toxic blooms of cyanobacteria generally occur in eutrophic or hypereutrophic waters. These blooms are influenced by pools of both nitrogen and phosphorus, coupled with the ability by many species for nitrogen fixation, blooms formation may last for prolonged periods.\nIn recreational waters, cyanobacteria can cause problems by decreasing dissolved oxygen concentrations during die off that may result in fish kills. In addition, cyanobacteria may produce taste and odor compounds that affect the taste of fish and can be a nuisance to those living or recreating on effected water bodies. Under favorable conditions, some cyanobacteria strains produce toxins that can cause illness and death in humans and animals. Cyanobacteria may produce one or several types of cyanotoxins that affect the liver (hepatotoxins), nervous system (neurotoxins) and skin (dermatoxins).\nCyanobacterial harmful algal blooms (cyanoHABs) are a growing concern in the global arena for their potential impact water quality, ecosystem services and human health. Increased eutrophication and climate change have resulted in the proliferation, intensification and prolonging of cyanoHABs around the world (Cook et al., 2019). Formation of blooms are regulated by water temperature, light availability and trophic conditions. Typically, cyanoHABs favor warm temperatures, high nutrient loads and low-flow conditions, conditions seen in many of the lakes and ponds of Delaware.\nBlooms may vary in species composition and toxin production over time and within a water body. Cyanobacteria can also be distributed as surface scums (e.g., Microcystis), at a particular depth (e.g., Planktothrix rubescens), or throughout the entire water column (e.g., Planktothrix sp.). Distribution of cyanobacteria can be affected by winds, rainfall, and lake turnover, in addition, some species can regulate buoyancy, allowing for vertical movement in the water column. These factors are important in understanding blooms as the absence of a surface bloom is not indicative of bloom presence.\nColor is also not indicative of bloom occurrence. While the name “blue-green algae” is a colloquial term for cyanobacteria, the color range of cyanobacteria can range from brown, white, black purple, red, green, or a combination. For example, Cylindrospermopsis may form blooms that are brown in color and may appear as suspended sediment. Blooms that appear green in color may be mistaken for non-harmful blooms of green algae. Proper distinguishing of cyanobacterial blooms is through processed satellite data, microscopic examination, or use of other cyanobacteria screening techniques (i.e., molecular methods, cyanotoxin field kits).\nIn addition to toxin production, cyanoHABs can have negative ecosystem health impacts and can raise concerns for drinking water, recreational water use and animals. While large blooms can produce excessive dissolved oxygen, when the bloom crashes it can decrease dissolved oxygen resulting in non-toxin related fish kills. Many cyanobacteria also produce taste and odor compounds that can affect the taste of fish and drinking water. Additionally, the foul smell produced by these blooms can also be a nuisance to those living and recreating on the water.\nCyanobacteria can produce a wide variety of secondary metabolites including peptides, polyketides, and alkaloids. These secondary metabolites can cause illness and potentially fatal in humans and animals, and may attack the liver, nerves, or skin. Some of the common cyanotoxins include microcystin, nodularin, saxitoxin, anatoxin-a, and cylindrospermopsin. Cyanotoxins can also bioaccumulate within the aquatic food web and may pose threat across all trophic levels. Many of the state-managed ponds have suffered from seasonal or episodic algal blooms that include potentially toxic cyanobacterial species. Microcystin has been found in low concentrations in several ponds but surveys of pond users indicated no evidence of direct toxic impacts to humans, pets, or wildlife.\nCurrently, there are an estimated 5000 extant species of algae in the marine environment. Among those species, approximately 300 are known to cause HABs, and like their freshwater counterpart, may produce toxins that can kill fish other marine organisms or accumulate in fish or shellfish tissue. Eutrophication of Delaware’s inland bays (DIB) has increased over the last several decades, with most of the nutrient input from agricultural and urban sources (Price, 1998; Sallade and Sims, 1997). Several harmful or potentially harmful species have been occurring frequently in DIB, with many occurring in the dead-end canals. Among those species are the dinoflagellates: Dinophysis spp., Gyrodinium instriatum, Karlodinium veneficum, and Prorocentrum minimum and several marine raphidophyte species: Heterosigma akashiwo, Chattonella subsalsa, Fibrocapsa japonica, and Viridilobus marinus.\nThe distribution of algae in the marine environment is influenced by a wide range of processes that include circulation, light and nutrient availability, as well as biological interactions. Algal dynamics is often driven by small to mesoscale processes where the water column is often stratified and areas where strong vertical density gradients occur, e.g., fjords, coastal lagoons, polar regions, and dead-end canals. This stratification can produce favorable conditions for the algae leading to large scale blooms, it has been observed that many large HAB species form in subsurface thin layers during bloom conditions . Algal growth has been classically measured as a whole-community response, with the use of chlorophyll as a proxy for abundance. However, this measurement has two presumptions: the community is taxonomically identical, and the community measurement adequately represents the dominant taxa. Similar to cyanoHABs, color is not indicative of a bloom occurrence. The term “red-tide” is a misnomer as color can range from green, brown, red, or “mahogany”. Proper distinguishing of blooms is through processed satellite data, microscopic examination, or use of other screening techniques (e.g., molecular methods).\nIn humans, toxicity can be caused by ingestion of contaminated seafood, skin contact, or inhalation of aerosolized toxins or noxious compounds. In food borne illness, HAB toxins are bioaccumulated, often without harming the vector marine organism that ingested the toxin and transfers up the food web to humans. Toxic effects are typically observed when the toxin producing species is at high concentration, however poisoning via seafood can also occur by highly toxic algae at lower concentrations. Indirect effects from toxin production have consequences on human well-being in terms of their socioeconomic impact and costs.\n","date":1603928649,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1603928649,"objectID":"c42ac55744b3c465e9c581ecb1c69027","permalink":"https://calandryll.github.io/project/habs/","publishdate":"2020-10-28T19:44:09-04:00","relpermalink":"/project/habs/","section":"project","summary":"How have algal blooms changed in Delaware's waters and how could they potentially change in the future?","tags":["HABs"],"title":"Harmful Algal Blooms","type":"project"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"One measurable type of potential human-related water pollution is fecal bacteria. These bacteria may derive from humans, various domesticated animals, i.e. dogs, cats, cows, etc. or from wild animals. Bacteria within the genus Enterococcus has been widely adopted to indicate the presence of fecal matter from warm-blooded animals in 305(b) monitoring efforts. Delaware has risk-based numeric criteria for Primary Contact Recreation (PCR) and Secondary Contact Recreation (SCR) in freshwater and saltwater “determined by the Department (DNREC) to be of non-wildlife origin based on best scientific judgment using available information”. Important among the limitations of the Enterococcus test is that it does not differentiate as to what type of animal the detected bacteria are from. It could be any mix of warm-blooded animal types that might be in the watershed – i.e. mammals and birds, domestic and wildlife.\nWhile these Enterococcus criteria are generally recognized to be protective of human health and the continuation of routine monitoring of waters is necessary to track status and trends, this test does not help in locating sources of bacterial contamination, which may be abatable. A supplemental, complimentary addition to the existing monitoring format is needed to facilitate where to apply pollution control practices and maximize the frugal utilization of the increasingly scarce resources available to bring about the environmental improvements intended under the CWA, such that waters meet standards criteria and attain designated uses, for example, PCR, SCR, fish, aquatic life and wildlife and harvestable shellfish waters.\nEcosystem services of coastal waters are important for community health, tourism and aquaculture. However, our coastal waters are under constant threats from pollution, land use change and increasing severe hydrologic events including coastal and areal flooding. Inherent in a coastal healthy ecosystem is a lack of pollution from anthropogenic influences, a tolerance for flooding without additional pollution and a resilient natural biota. A main threat to coastal ecosystem health is the introduction of fecal material from humans, pets and livestock. As waste material these concerns are primary for human health, but also of concern is that infectious materials can be spread between species. As such, the continual monitoring of waterways for fecal material is inherent to statewide monitoring efforts. If bacterial loads are raised in waterways, tourism can be shut down and aquaculture can be impacted. As such the spread of bacteria in the environment is of great concern for the continued maintenance of a healthy coastal ecosystem.\nIn the state of Delaware, the Department of Natural Resources and Environmental Control (DNREC) Department of Water, located in the Office of Environmental Protection, produces data for the monitoring of waterway health. The DNREC Department of Watershed Stewardship, located in the Office of Natural Resources, is responsible for enacting policies and actual management of watersheds. While the data produced regarding microbial impairment of waterway health can be acted on by stakeholders for conservation and ecosystem service health priorities, the watershed-level impacts of waterway impairment are often not able to be acted upon, as the data collected by standard required measurements are not explicit enough to enact policy level enforcement by the Department of Watershed Stewardship. Our project seeks to gain detailed data on the microbial impairment of coastal waters in Delaware, tracking the sources of microbial input from watershed areas, in powerful enough form to compel the offices within DNREC, and potentially as large as the EPA, to reconsider the practices of waterway monitoring and policy enforcement regarding potential microbial pollution.\n","date":1603843200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1603843200,"objectID":"fde21a44f4f3cc2cd93647563a32f2ee","permalink":"https://calandryll.github.io/project/microbial-source-tracking/","publishdate":"2020-10-28T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/microbial-source-tracking/","section":"project","summary":"What organisms may be contributing to Delaware's high bacterial loads?","tags":["MST"],"title":"Microbial Source Tracking","type":"project"},{"authors":["A.

In Delaware, blooms normally occur between July and October, yet no in‐depth analyses of the causes and predictors exist. A study using commercially available, high‐frequency, continuous, and automated biogeochemical sensors at Coursey Pond, Delaware, a pond known for perennial summer blooms, was conducted to investigate how hydrophysical and hydrochemical conditions affect bloom dynamics. Cyanobacterial abundance (based on the in vivo phycocyanin fluorescence and phycocyanin/chlorophyll fluorescence ratios) increases during periods of high water temperatures (up to 32°C), low discharge through the pond (mean hydraulic residence time ≥5 d) with evaporative concentration of dissolved solids, and decreasing NO3− concentrations (reaching −1, the detection limit). These conditions lead to the uptake and depletion of bioavailable N in the pond surface waters and provide a competitive advantage for temperature‐tolerant and N‐fixing cyanobacteria. Irrigation water use within the watershed can exceed pond discharge during drier summer months, enhancing bloom‐forming conditions. Bloom intensity varies due to storms but persists until mid‐October to mid‐November when temperatures cool, daylength decreases, and discharge and NO3− concentration recovers. Changes in these easily monitored physical and chemical parameters can serve to anticipate the onset, intensity, persistence, and the eventual dissipation of cyanobacterial blooms at Coursey Pond and similar ponds elsewhere. Therefore, the use of sensors and high‐frequency data has the potential to assist in forecasting and management of blooms.","tags":["\"harmful algal blooms\"","\"cyanobacteria\""],"title":"Hydrophysical and Hydrochemical Controls of Cyanobacterial Blooms in Coursey Pond, Delaware (USA)","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Christopher R.

The relative abundances of particle-associated Vibrio spp. and algal classes that form blooms in DIB (dinoflagellates, diatoms, and raphidophytes) were determined using quantitative PCR. The results demonstrated a significant correlation between particle-associated Vibrio abundance and phytoplankton, with higher correlations to diatoms and raphidophytes than to dinoflagellates. Species-specific associations were examined during a mixed bloom of Heterosigma akashiwo and Fibrocapsa japonica (Raphidophyceae) and indicated a significant positive correlation for particle-associated Vibrio abundance with H. akashiwo but a negative correlation with F. japonica . Changes in Vibrio assemblages during the bloom were evaluated using automated ribosomal intergenic spacer analysis (ARISA), which revealed significant differences between each size fraction but no significant change in Vibrio assemblages over the course of the bloom. Microzooplankton grazing experiments showed that losses of particle-associated Vibrio spp. may be offset by increased growth in the Vibrio population. Moreover, analysis of Vibrio assemblages by ARISA also indicated an increase in the relative abundance for specific members of the Vibrio community despite higher grazing pressure on the particle-associated population as a whole.
