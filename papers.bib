abstract = {Vibrio species are an abundant and diverse group of bacteria that form associations with phytoplankton. Correlations between Vibrio and phytoplankton abundance have been noted, suggesting that growth is enhanced during algal blooms or that association with phytoplankton provides a refuge from predation. Here, we investigated relationships between particle-associated Vibrio spp. and phytoplankton in Delaware's inland bays (DIB). The relative abundances of particle-associated Vibrio spp. and algal classes that form blooms in DIB (dinoflagellates, diatoms, and raphidophytes) were determined using quantitative PCR. The results demonstrated a significant correlation between particle-associated Vibrio abundance and phytoplankton, with higher correlations to diatoms and raphidophytes than to dinoflagellates. Species-specific associations were examined during a mixed bloom of Heterosigma akashiwo and Fibrocapsa japonica (Raphidophyceae) and indicated a significant positive correlation for particle-associated Vibrio abundance with H. akashiwo but a negative correlation with F. japonica . Changes in Vibrio assemblages during the bloom were evaluated using automated ribosomal intergenic spacer analysis (ARISA), which revealed significant differences between each size fraction but no significant change in Vibrio assemblages over the course of the bloom. Microzooplankton grazing experiments showed that losses of particle-associated Vibrio spp. may be offset by increased growth in the Vibrio population. Moreover, analysis of Vibrio assemblages by ARISA also indicated an increase in the relative abundance for specific members of the Vibrio community despite higher grazing pressure on the particle-associated population as a whole. The results of this investigation demonstrate links between phytoplankton and Vibrio that may lead to predictions of potential health risks and inform future management practices in this region.},

abstract = {Eutrophication in coastal water has compromised ecosystem services. Identification of phosphorus (P) sources and their load contributions are required for the development of effective nutrient management plans. In this research, multi-isotope proxies were applied to track P sources and evaluate their relative contributions in Love Creek, a coastal estuary in Delaware. The isotope values of carbon (ca. −22‰), nitrogen (ca.+6‰), and phosphate oxygen (ca.+18‰) of agricultural soils under different agricultural practices are generally similar even though their concentrations are distinctly different from forest soils ($\delta$13C: ca. −27‰; $\delta$13N: ca.+2‰; $\delta$18OP: ca.+22‰). Comparison of these parameters among potential land sources (agricultural soils, forest soils, septic wastes, and plant debris) and sink (colloids in water) revealed that the plant debris and soils from forest sources are likely dominant sources of P in freshwater sites. The contribution of terrestrial P sources gradually decreased along the salinity gradient and agricultural soil sources gradually dominanted in the saline water portion of the creek. The variations of P loads due to weather-related discharge, changing land use and activities, and seasons were high and reflected the limitation of accurate estimation of sources. Overall, these results provide improved insights into potential sources and biogeochemical processes in the estuary, which are expected to be useful for water quality monitoring programs.},
