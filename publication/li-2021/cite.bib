 abstract = {Eutrophication in coastal water has compromised ecosystem services. Identification of phosphorus (P) sources and their load contributions are required for the development of effective nutrient management plans. In this research, multi-isotope proxies were applied to track P sources and evaluate their relative contributions in Love Creek, a coastal estuary in Delaware. The isotope values of carbon (ca. −22‰), nitrogen (ca.+6‰), and phosphate oxygen (ca.+18‰) of agricultural soils under different agricultural practices are generally similar even though their concentrations are distinctly different from forest soils ($δ$13C: ca. −27‰; $δ$13N: ca.+2‰; $δ$18OP: ca.+22‰). Comparison of these parameters among potential land sources (agricultural soils, forest soils, septic wastes, and plant debris) and sink (colloids in water) revealed that the plant debris and soils from forest sources are likely dominant sources of P in freshwater sites. The contribution of terrestrial P sources gradually decreased along the salinity gradient and agricultural soil sources gradually dominanted in the saline water portion of the creek. The variations of P loads due to weather-related discharge, changing land use and activities, and seasons were high and reflected the limitation of accurate estimation of sources. Overall, these results provide improved insights into potential sources and biogeochemical processes in the estuary, which are expected to be useful for water quality monitoring programs.},
